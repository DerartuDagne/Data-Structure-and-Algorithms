# Linked List Linear Data structure

In Python, a linked list is a fundamental data structure consisting of nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence.

A node contains two things first is data and second is a link that connects it with another node allowing for efficient memory management. 

This structure enables efficient insertion and deletion of elements without affecting the positions of other elements in the list,

as opposed to data structures that rely on contiguous memory like arrays or lists.


## Why Linked Lists?

Linked lists were created to overcome various drawbacks associated with storing data in regular lists and arrays, as outlined below:
