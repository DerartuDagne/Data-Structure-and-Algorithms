# BIG O Notation

Big O is a method for evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. It describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm, allowing for comparison of the efficiency of different algorithms. Big O notation is an essential tool for computer scientists and Software Engineer to assess and compare the time and space complexity of algorithms.

## Why we need BIG O ?

Big O notation is crucial for assessing, selecting, and predicting the performance of algorithms, offering a standardized and theoretical framework that is essential in computer science and software engineering.
### Why don't we use actual execution time to compare and evaluate algorithms instead of Big O notation?
1. **Hardware Independence**:
   Actual execution time can vary based on hardware factors like processor speed and memory. Big O notation abstracts these details, offering a hardware-independent way to analyze and compare algorithm efficiency.
2. **Input Sensitivity**:
   Execution time can fluctuate with input specifics, such as data order in sorting. Big O notation focuses on worst-case scenarios and growth rates with input size, providing clarity on how algorithms scale with larger inputs.

3. **Scalability**:
   Small input time measurements may not predict large input performance accurately. Big O notation clarifies how runtime or space requirements grow, crucial for estimating performance with extensive datasets.

4. **Simplicity and Consistency**:
   Real-time measurements are susceptible to system load and other variables, complicating consistent comparisons. Big O offers a simplified, consistent approach, emphasizing dominant growth factors while disregarding constant factors and lower-order terms.

5. **Theoretical Insight**:
   While real-time data aids practical assessments, Big O allows for abstract reasoning, proving algorithmic properties mathematically, aiding theoretical analysis and understanding.
